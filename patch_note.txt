-Math: trigger pull for subs can now tell you if its a community sub or not.

-You can now uninstall extensions from a selected transmitter
-Some changes were made to the transmitter to give the test button more options to play with, thanks to Christinna.

-new transmitter command to lioranboard "AppendStack" check the extension documentation for that.
-Twitch: Open Whisper now works on True and false accordingly, whispers are off by default.
-Parameter "small math" has been greatly improved so lets call them Complex math from now on. If you didn't know before, you could put (2+3) in a parameter box to do some math
	As long as the box start with ( and ended ), it performed the small math, This was very limited,it would only take numbers and only 2.
	it can take anything now, Something as complex as this would work. (2+round($FFF*2.1)mod 7 ^ 1 + variable)
	it accepts *,+,/,-,^,|,&,$ for hex,round(),ceil(),floor(),mod,div,() inside () and straight up variable names and [x]stackname values
	the whole box must still start with ( and end with ). this can be done on any parameter box and a maximum of 256 characters is allowed
	Keep in mind the bigger you make it the slower it is to process.... but hey computers are suposed to be super fast these days right?
	You can also include stacks written as such [slotnumber]stackname, inside [] can be some complex math [1+variable*10]stackname will work fine
-Commands Skip if, Redo if, End if, Repeat previous have been Deprecated(they will still work but have been replaced by better one).
	In the deck edit window there is a check box at the top now that you can turn on to replace commands from a button.
	The replacement will happen when you open the command window of a button. and will only be fully applied when you clicked Done and done again.
	Commands Replaced by the following one

-Statement: If					New command, (replace skip if)Works like a programming language If statemenet, creates an else statement along with it.
-Statement: Re-enable			New command, (replace Redo if)Work same as Redo if but with different options
-Statement: Repeat 				New command, Repeat commands immediatly
-Statement: Exit if				New command, (Replace End if)same as end if but take variable names different
-Statement: Break if			New command, Will exit a Re-enable or Repeat statement
-Statement: And 				New command, Put this right under a if statement, re-enable, Exit or Break to give it extra checks. can put multiple of them and combine with Or
-Statement: Or 					New command, Put this right under a if statement, re-enable, Exit or Break to give it extra checks. can put multiple and combine them with And
-Deprecated commands will all be all under the "-Deprecated- >" option in the command list

	If the box of a parameter says "Var./real/string" or has a * in the name that means you can put  "some text" for a string(or with ')   -.012 for a real $A0 for a real in hex number.
	[x]stackname to load a stack value directly. you can do complex math inside the [x] such as [1+variable*2]
	and anything else for a variable.
	Variables should always start with a letter or _ and only contains letters, numbers and _
	Your variable can be   Hello_123    or    _123_hello     but not    123_Hello

-Command Math: Change Variable / Math: Variable to Variable / Stack: Add / Stack: Replace / Stack: Find    now all have a new improved version
	Old one are still available in the deprecated section 
	you will see them as (new) in the command list
	Math: variable to variable is no longer needed
	the only change is that the value box now takes real/string/variable and the real/string box is removed for the stack one
