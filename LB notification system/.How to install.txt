If you use the Polly TTS made by Christinna you can use the TTS in normal Dock instead of Chrome.

Go in the command list for "Master Animator" and "TTS voices" and delete every commands in there.
Now go in the "Alternate Master Animator", Click the check box at the top left to select every command and click "Copy selected commands"
and paste them in the normal Master Animator button. Do the same thing for Alternate TTS voices.
The TTS should now work in dock mode.
